# Taylor Swift Albums
Taylor Swift Albums is a simple React Native app that allows users to see her albums and link to an amazon page where they can purchase them

## Purpose
this App was mainly built so that I could experiment with React Native and explore some of the differences between it and regular React. This App was built following an online tutorial from Stephen Grider's `The Complete React Native and Redux Course` https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/

## Getting Started
run the following in your terminal
```
git clone git@github.com:BrooklinJazz/Taylor-Swift-Albums.git
npm install
npm start
```

then open with your prefered emulator, or use Expo on your mobile device.

## Technologies Used:
